ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY

This repository contains an attempt to create an iOS-app which contains
basic text manipulation tools which are always available on PCs.

I want to implement following functionalities.
	* ed
	* ls
	* grep
	* find
	* something equivalent to pipe
And I want to achieve them by importing existing implementation as much as
possible, rather than reimplementing.
