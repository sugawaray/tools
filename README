ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY
=====================

This repository contains an attempt to create an iOS-app which contains
basic text manipulation tools which are always available on PCs.

I want to implement following functionalities.
	* ed
	* ls
	* grep
	* find
	* something equivalent to pipe
And I want to achieve them by importing existing implementation as much as
possible.

SHELL COMMAND IMPLEMENTATION
============================

I use busybox as shell commands implementation.

BUILD PROCEDURE
===============

Currently I use following procedure to build.
(This is very dirty. But I'll make it better after I understand busybox build
system.)

On the host shell
	make oldconfig
	make applets_dir

Then on the xcode
	build

IMPLEMENTED COMMANDS
====================

Currently following commands are implemented.
(are imported from the busybox implementation.)

* seq n1 n2
* ls path
* mkdir path

Only the most basic calls are tested.
